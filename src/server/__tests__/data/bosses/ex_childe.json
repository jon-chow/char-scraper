  "description": "\"Childe\" Tartaglia, Eleventh of the Fatui Harbingers. He draws power from the ominous Delusion he possesses and fights using martial arts that he learned in the land of darkness.\n\nHe is a pure warrior with an insatiable lust for battle. Each bloody conflict, each life-and-death struggle is a delightful trial for him. People say that the young Childe is famed throughout the land for his battle prowess. But he has never taken big talk of this kind to heart.\n\nAfter all...\n\"You shall ever be the eye of the storm,\"\n\"And the clashing of steel shall ever accompany you.\"\n\"The pitch-black memory of stepping into uttermost darkness,\"\n\"Shall, at last, become the strength by which you will overturn this world.\"",
